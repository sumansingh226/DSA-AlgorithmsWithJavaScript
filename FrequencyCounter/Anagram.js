// An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase,
//  using all the original letters exactly once. Essentially,
//   it's a permutation of the letters of a word or phrase to create a new word or phrase.

// For example, the word "listen" and "silent" are anagrams of each other because they contain
// the exact same letters.
