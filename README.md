2. **Insertion:** Adding elements to the array.
3. **Deletion:** Removing elements from the array.
4. **Traversal:** Iterating through all elements in the array.

### Common Array Methods

1. `push()` and `pop()`: Adding and removing elements from the end of the array.
2. `unshift()` and `shift()`: Adding and removing elements from the beginning of the array.

## Strings

### Introduction

Strings are sequences of characters and are used to represent text in programming. In JavaScript, strings are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.

### Basic Operations

1. **Accessing Characters:** Accessing characters by index.
2. **Concatenation:** Combining two or more strings.
3. **Substring:** Extracting a portion of a string.
4. **Length:** Finding the length of a string.

### Common String Methods

1. `charAt()`, `charCodeAt()`, and `substring()`: Retrieving characters and substrings.
2. `concat()`: Concatenating strings.
3. `slice()`: Extracting a portion of a string.
4. `indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()`: Finding the index of a character or substring.
5. `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()`: Changing the case of a string.
6. `trim()`: Removing whitespace from the beginning and end of a string.

### String Iteration

1. **for...of loop:** Iterating through characters in a string.
2. **forEach():** Using array methods on strings.

### Pattern Matching

1. **Regular Expressions (RegExp):** Defining and using regular expressions for pattern matching.

### Problems and Solutions

1. **Palindrome Check:** Determining if a string is a palindrome.
2. **Anagram Check:** Checking if two strings are anagrams.
3. **Reverse String:** Reversing the characters in a string.
4. **String Compression:** Compressing a string by counting repeated characters.

### Advanced String Topics

1. **String Interpolation:** Building strings dynamically using template literals.
2. **Internationalization (i18n):** Handling multilingual strings.
3. **Encoding and Decoding:** Methods like `encodeURI()` and `decodeURI()`.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Introduction

Sorting algorithms are essential in computer science and are used to arrange elements in a specific order. Proper understanding of sorting algorithms is crucial for writing efficient code and optimizing performance.

### Common Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort:**

   - Basic comparison-based sorting algorithm.
   - Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. **Selection Sort:**

   - In-place comparison-based sorting algorithm.
   - Divides the input list into two parts: a sorted and an unsorted region.

3. **Insertion Sort:**

   - Simple and intuitive sorting algorithm.
   - Builds the final sorted array one element at a time.

4. **Merge Sort:**

   - Divide and conquer algorithm.
   - Divides the unsorted list into `n` sub-lists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merges sub-lists to produce new sorted sub-lists.

5. **QuickSort:**

   - Divide and conquer algorithm.
   - Picks a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays according to the pivot, then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

6. **Heap Sort:**
   - Comparison-based sorting algorithm.
   - Builds a binary heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum element from it.

### Comparison of Sorting Algorithms

- **Time Complexity:** Understand the time complexity of each sorting algorithm in various scenarios (best-case, average-case, worst-case).
- **Space Complexity:** Analyze the space complexity of sorting algorithms.
- **Stability:** Consider whether the sorting algorithm preserves the relative order of equal elements.

### When to Use Which Algorithm

- **Small Datasets:** Consider simpler algorithms like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort.
- **Nearly Sorted Data:** Insertion Sort may perform well.
- **Large Datasets:** Merge Sort, QuickSort, or Heap Sort are often preferred.
- **Stable Sorting:** Use algorithms like Merge Sort or Bubble Sort.

### Advanced Sorting Topics

1. **External Sorting:** Techniques for sorting data that is too large to fit into memory.
2. **Parallel Sorting:** Strategies for sorting large datasets in parallel.
3. **Hybrid Sorting Algorithms:** Combining different sorting algorithms for improved performance.

## Searching

### Introduction

Searching algorithms are used to find the presence or absence of a target value in a collection of items. These algorithms play a crucial role in information retrieval, databases, and various other applications.

### Common Searching Algorithms

1. **Linear Search:**

   - Basic searching algorithm that iterates through each element until the target is found or the end of the array is reached.

2. **Binary Search:**

   - Efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted collection.
   - Divides the search interval in half at each step.

3. **Jump Search:**

   - Improved version of linear search for sorted arrays.
   - Jumps ahead by a fixed number of steps, then performs linear search in the subset.

4. **Interpolation Search:**
   - Similar to binary search but uses interpolation to find the probable position of the target.

### Comparison of Searching Algorithms

- **Time Complexity:** Understand the time complexity of each searching algorithm in various scenarios.
- **Space Complexity:** Analyze the space complexity of searching algorithms.

### When to Use Which Algorithm

- **Unsorted Data:** Linear search is a simple choice.
- **Sorted Data:** Binary search or interpolation search can be more efficient.
- **Large Datasets:** Consider advanced techniques like hash-based searching.

### Advanced Searching Topics

1. **Hash-Based Searching:** Utilizing hash functions and data structures for faster searches.
2. **Ternary Search:** Divide and conquer approach with three search intervals.
3. **Exponential Search:** Combining binary search with an exponential probe.

### Search in Different Data Structures

#### 1. Searching in Arrays

When dealing with arrays, different searching algorithms can be applied depending on the nature of the data.

- **Linear Search:**

  - Suitable for unsorted arrays.
  - Time complexity: O(n).

- **Binary Search:**

  - Ideal for sorted arrays.
  - Time complexity: O(log n).

- **Interpolation Search:**
  - Effective for uniformly distributed sorted arrays.
  - Time complexity: O(log log n).

#### 2. Searching in Trees

Searching in trees, especially binary trees, involves navigating through nodes to find a specific value.

- **Binary Search Tree (BST):**

  - Utilizes the properties of a BST to efficiently search for a node.
  - Time complexity: O(log n) in average case.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS):**

  - Can be applied to traverse through a tree and search for a specific value.
  - Pre-order, in-order, and post-order variants.

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
  - Useful for level-order traversal and searching in a tree.

#### 3. Searching in Hash Tables

Hash tables provide a fast and efficient way to retrieve values based on keys using hash functions.

- **Hash Function:**

  - The hash function maps keys to indices in the hash table.
  - Uniform distribution is essential for optimal performance.

- **Collision Handling:**

  - Techniques like separate chaining or open addressing to handle collisions.

- **Hash-based Search:**
  - Achieves constant time complexity O(1) on average for retrieving values.
