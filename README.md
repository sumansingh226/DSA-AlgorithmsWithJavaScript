## Stacks

### Introduction

A stack is a fundamental Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure used in computer science. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack. It follows the principle of adding new elements on top and removing the most recently added element. Stacks are widely used in various algorithms and applications for their simplicity and efficiency.

### Basic Operations

1. **Push:**

   - Add an element to the top of the stack.

2. **Pop:**

   - Remove the element from the top of the stack.

3. **Peek (or Top):**
   - Retrieve the top element without removing it.

### Applications

1. **Function Call Management:**

   - Stacks are used to manage function calls and local variables during program execution. Each function call gets a stack frame, and when a function completes, its frame is popped.

2. **Expression Evaluation:**

   - In arithmetic expression evaluation, stacks help process operators and operands. They play a crucial role in converting infix expressions to postfix or prefix forms.

3. **Undo Mechanisms:**
   - Stacks are employed in implementing undo mechanisms in applications. Each action gets pushed onto the stack, and undoing involves popping the last action.

### Challenges

1. **Balanced Parentheses:**

   - Stacks are used to check if an expression has balanced parentheses. Each opening bracket gets pushed, and when a closing bracket is encountered, it should match the top element.

2. **Next Greater Element:**
   - Stacks can efficiently find the next greater element for each element in an array. Elements are pushed onto the stack until a greater element is encountered.

### Advanced Topics

1. **Min Stack:**

   - An extension of the stack that supports constant-time retrieval of the minimum element in the stack. It involves maintaining an additional stack for minimum values.

2. **Expression Conversion:**
   - Stacks are used in converting infix expressions to postfix or prefix forms. Operators are pushed and popped based on their precedence.

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Space Complexity:**

   - Analyze the space requirements of different stack implementations. Array-based implementations may have fixed-size limitations, while linked list-based implementations allow dynamic memory allocation.

2. **Choosing Implementation:**
   - The choice between array-based and linked list-based implementations depends on usage patterns. Arrays offer constant-time access but may require resizing, while linked lists provide dynamic memory allocation.

## Queues

### Introduction

A queue is a fundamental First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure that manages elements in a linear order. In a queue, elements are enqueued (added) to the rear and dequeued (removed) from the front. Queues are widely used in algorithms and real-world applications for efficient task scheduling, breadth-first search, and resource management.

### Basic Operations

1. **Enqueue:**

   - Add an element to the rear of the queue.

2. **Dequeue:**

   - Remove an element from the front of the queue.

3. **Front (Peek):**
   - Retrieve the front element without removal.

### Applications

1. **Task Scheduling:**

   - Queues are used to manage tasks in the order they arrive. The first task added is the first to be processed.

2. **Breadth-First Search:**

   - In graph algorithms like BFS, queues facilitate traversing levels in a hierarchical structure level by level.

3. **Resource Management:**
   - Queues control access to shared resources, ensuring fair and orderly utilization.

### Challenges

1. **Circular Queue:**

   - In a circular queue, elements are enqueued and dequeued in a circular manner, efficiently utilizing space.

2. **Queue using Stacks:**
   - Implementing a queue using two stacks, showcasing how queues can be simulated using other data structures.

### Advanced Topics

#### 1. Priority Queue:

- **Definition:**
  - A variation of a queue where elements have assigned priorities.
- **Implementation:**
  - Implemented using a binary heap or other priority queue data structures.
- **Usage:**
  - Useful in scenarios where elements need to be processed based on their priority level.

#### 2. Double-ended Queue (Deque):

- **Definition:**
  - A versatile queue that supports insertion and deletion at both ends.
- **Operations:**
  - Allows operations such as `insertFront`, `insertRear`, `deleteFront`, and `deleteRear`.
- **Usage:**
  - Provides more flexibility and is suitable for scenarios where elements need to be added or removed from both ends.

#### 3. Circular Queue with Dynamic Resizing:

- **Challenge:**
  - Overcomes the limitation of fixed-size circular queues.
- **Dynamic Resizing:**
  - Dynamically resizes the circular queue when it reaches capacity, allowing for a more adaptable and space-efficient implementation.

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Space Complexity:**

   - Analyze the space requirements of different queue implementations. Array-based implementations may have fixed-size limitations, while linked list-based implementations allow dynamic memory allocation.

2. **Choosing Implementation:**
   - Choose between array-based and linked list-based implementations based on specific use cases. Arrays offer constant-time access, while linked lists allow for dynamic resizing.

# Trees

## Introduction

Trees are hierarchical data structures widely used in computer science to represent relationships, hierarchies, and organized data. A tree consists of nodes connected by edges, forming a structure where each node has a parent-child relationship with others.

### Basic Tree Components

1. **Node:**
   - The fundamental building block of a tree containing data and pointers to child nodes.
2. **Root:**
   - The topmost node in a tree, serving as the starting point for traversals.
3. **Parent and Child:**
   - Nodes in a tree have relationships; a parent node has child nodes, and child nodes have a parent.

### Types of Trees

1. **Binary Tree:**
   - Each node can have at most two children: a left child and a right child.
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST):**
   - A binary tree with a specific ordering; the left child is less than the parent, and the right child is greater.
3. **AVL Tree:**
   - A self-balancing binary search tree to maintain logarithmic height, ensuring efficient operations.
4. **B-Tree:**
   - A balanced tree used for efficient searching in databases, particularly in file systems.

### Common Operations

1. **Traversal:**
   - Traversing the nodes of a tree in a specific order: in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.
2. **Insertion and Deletion:**
   - Adding and removing nodes while maintaining the hierarchical structure.

### Advanced Topics

1. **Trie:**
   - A tree-like data structure used for efficient searches of strings and dynamic sets.
2. **Segment Tree:**
   - A versatile data structure for handling range query operations on an array.
