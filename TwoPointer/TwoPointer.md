Two Pointer is Normally used for searching and it use two pointer ,
in one loop over the given data structure. This ia a quite common approach
which is used to solve coding problems, mostly related to strings, arrays, linked list.

In order to use two pointer , most of the times the data structure needs to be ordered in some way, which helps us to reduce the time complexity from O(n2) or O(n3) of just one loop with two pointer and search each item at one

so depending on wether the input string/array is sorted or not , the two-pointer method can take O(nlogn) time complexity or even better which is O(n)
