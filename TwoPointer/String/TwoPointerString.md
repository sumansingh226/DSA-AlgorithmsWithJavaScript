1. [*] Valid Palindrome: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
2. [*] Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
3. [*] Longest Palindromic Substring: Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.
4. [*] Minimum Window Substring: Given two strings s and t, return the minimum window in s which will contain all the characters in t in complexity O(n).
5. [*] Implement strStr(): Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
6. [*] Longest Common Prefix: Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
7. [*] Valid Parentheses: Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
8. [*] Implement Regular Expression Matching: Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '\*'.
9. [*] Wildcard Matching: Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '\*'.
10. [*] Generate Parentheses: Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.
11. [*] Count and Say: The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:
    - countAndSay(1) = "1"
    - countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a different digit string.
12. [*] Integer to Roman: Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.
13. [*] Roman to Integer: Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
14. [*] Longest Common Subsequence: Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
15. [*] Edit Distance: Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.
16. [*] Longest Palindromic Subsequence: Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.
17. [*] Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings: Given two strings s1, s2, find the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.
18. [*] Palindrome Partitioning II: Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.
19. [*] Longest Repeating Substring: Given a string s, find out the length of the longest repeating substring(s). Return 0 if no repeating substring exists.
20. [*] Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters: Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.
21. [*] Find All Anagrams in a String: Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.
22. [*] Valid Palindrome II: Given a string s, return true if the s can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.
23. [*] Shortest Palindrome: Given a string s, you are allowed to convert it to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.
24. [*] Count Substrings with Only One Distinct Letter: Given a string S, return the number of substrings that have only one distinct letter.
25. [*] Find All Duplicates in a String: Given a string, find all the duplicates in it.
26. [*] Shortest Word Distance: Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
27. [*] Shortest Word Distance II: Design a data structure that will be initialized with a list of words. You will be given a string word1 and a string word2, and you will return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
28. [*] Minimum Window Subsequence: Given strings S and T, find the minimum (contiguous) substring W of S, so that T is a subsequence of W.
29. [*] Longest Chunked Palindrome Decomposition: Return the largest possible k such that there exists a_1, a_2, ..., a_k such that:
    - Each a_i is a non-empty string;
