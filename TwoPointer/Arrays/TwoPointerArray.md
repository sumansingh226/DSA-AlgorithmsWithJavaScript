12. [ ] Reverse Linked List: Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return its head.
13. [ ] Merge Two Sorted Lists: Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

18. [ ] Partition List: Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
19. [ ] Next Permutation: Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.
20. [ ] Implement strStr(): Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
21. [ ] Search in Rotated Sorted Array: There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). Prior to being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]. Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
22. [ ] Container With Most Water: Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai), n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
23. [ ] Partition Array Into Three Parts With Equal Sum: Given an array of integers arr, return true if we can partition the array into three non-empty parts with equal sums.
24. [ ] Number of Subarrays with Bounded Maximum: We are given an array nums of positive integers, and two positive integers left and right (left <= right). Return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays such that the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is at least left and at most right.
25. [ ] Subarray Product Less Than K: Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than k.
26. [ ] Sum of Subarray Minimums: Given an array of integers arr, find the sum of min(b) where b ranges over every (contiguous) subarray of arr. Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
27. [ ] Valid Mountain Array: Given an array of integers arr, return true if and only if it is a valid mountain array.
28. [ ] Maximum Width Ramp: Given an array nums of integers, a ramp is a tuple (i, j) for which i < j and nums[i] <= nums[j]. The width of such a ramp is j - i. The maximum width of a ramp in nums is the largest such ramp width.

B[i - 1] < B[i] > B[i + 1] > ... > B[B.length - 1] (Note that B could be any subarray of A, including the entire array A.). Given an array A of integers, return the length of the longest mountain.
