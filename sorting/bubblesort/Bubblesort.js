// Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list,
//  compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are
// in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
//  It's not efficient for large datasets, but it's easy to understand and implement,
//   making it suitable for educational purposes or small datasets
