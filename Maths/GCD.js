/*The greatest common divisor (GCD), also known as the greatest common factor (GCF) or highest common
 factor (HCF), is the largest positive integer that divides two or more numbers without leaving a remainder.
  There are various methods to find the GCD of two or more numbers.*/

/*Euclidean Algorithm:

Take two numbers, say a and b.
Divide the larger number by the smaller one.
Replace the larger number with the smaller one and the smaller number with the remainder.
Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.
The last non-zero remainder is the GCD*/
